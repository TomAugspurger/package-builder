About
-----

This repo is a holding area for recipes to fill a conda channel. The builder is based on https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-smithy and https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/.

The resulting conda packages can be found in the [`janschulz` anaconda channel](https://anaconda.org/janschulz/).

If you want to use packages from this channel:

```
conda install -c janschulz pypandoc
```

You can also permanently add the channel so that you don't need to add `-c janschul` to each `conda install` and `conda update`:

```
conda config --add channels http://conda.anaconda.org/janschulz
conda install pypandoc
```
